                <h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>
                <p>Dragon Ball Z was a gateway drug for many a young anime fan, and for good reason. The series isn't particularly deep, as it basically revolves around superhuman martial artist Goku and his friends testing their mettle against an increasingly powerful and outlandish series of foes. </p>

                <h2>Haikyuu!!</h2>
                <p>There are not many sports anime that can knock it out of the park in almost every way but Haikyuu!! manages to do that. The series revolves around a fairly large ensemble consisting of a high school volleyball team. Even though that may seem like a hurdle, the character development is well balanced</p>

                <h2>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</h2>
                <p>Oh my god! This is a normal response from watching this weirdly amazing shounen anime that follows the different generations of the Joestar family. The influential manga series has been around since 1987 and has only been airing the anime since 2012. It was tough to decide on which part </p>

                <h2>My Hero Academia</h2>
                <p>Superhero stories are a dime a dozen, but My Hero Academia offers a unique twist on the familiar genre by focusing on Izuku Midoriya, a hero who was born without powers (but is determined to save people regardless) in a world full of folks with abilities. Even after he earns the "quirk" he's always </p>

                <h2>Trigun</h2>
                <p>Trigun is a classic late 90s sci-fi space Western taking place on a desert planet literally called, No Man's Land. The Protagonist, Vash the Stampede isn't your typical strong and stoic gunslinger. Rather he's a quirky goofy guy in an awesome red duster coat with a hyperactive pacifist streak.</p>
